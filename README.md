# CS50 Runoff Solution 2023

This repository contains my solution to **Runoff** from _Problem Set 3_ from the **CS50** course in 2023. I've made slight modifications to ensure it works in the real _Visual Studio Code_ (VSCode) software, such as:

- Renaming `#include <cs50.h>` to `#include "cs50.h"`

I wanted to take a moment to explain the complexity you may notice in this code. It's a result of needing to meet the specific requirements of the automated checks in the CS50 course. While the code could have been simplified, these checks necessitated a more elaborate structure to ensure that each requirement was met accurately.
Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
